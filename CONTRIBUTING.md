## Pull request
Please set up an issue and assign it to yourself before working on a feature so we can know who is working on what. 
@ddiannae is in charge of doing the merges, so please wait for her to close your PR.

- Just one feature/bugfix per PR please. Try to keep changes small.
- Be as descriptive as possible in your pull request's description. Include text "Closes #ISSUE_NUM" (case insensitive but the space must be present) for GitHub to link and close the corresponding issue when the PR is merged.
If multiple issues are being closed, add that many "Closes #ISSUE" lines.
