# Contributing
(Ideas taken from the `data.table` package [Contributing](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Contributing) page)

Please fill one Issue for one purpose. Take a look at the open [Issues](https://github.com/CSB-IG/RNA-seq/issues) and feel free to assign yourself to the issue you want to contribute. 

## Pull request
Please set up an issue and assign it to yourself before working on a feature so we can know who is working on what. 
Diana @ddiannae is in charge of doing the merges, so please wait for her to close your PR.

- Just one feature/bugfix per PR please. Try to keep changes small.
- Be as descriptive as possible in your pull request's description. Include text "Closes #ISSUE_NUM" (case insensitive but the space must be present) for GitHub to link and close the corresponding issue when the PR is merged.
If multiple issues are being closed, add that many "Closes #ISSUE" lines.
- Please create the PR against the master branch. You can do that by forking the repository, creating a new branch for your feature/bugfix in the forked project, and then using that as a base for your pull requests.  

If you have any doubt about creating an issue or a pull request, you can check this link: [How to GitHub: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request](https://www.gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request) or you can ask anyone on the group (preferably Rodrigo @rodogi)
